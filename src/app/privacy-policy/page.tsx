                <p>
                    Welcome to [Your App Name], the dedicated app for pet assistance.
                    Your privacy is critically important to us. At [Your App Name],
                    we have a few fundamental principles:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
                    (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or
                    income level for no apparent reason.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply
                    with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required
                    for the on-going operation of one of our services.
                </p>
                <h2>Information Collection And Use</h2>
                <p>
                    While using our app, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally
                    identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you.
                    Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to,
                    your name and email address ("Personal Information").
                </p>
                <h2>Log Data</h2>
                <p>
                    Like many app operators, we collect information that your device sends
                    whenever you use our App ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include
                    information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address,
                    device type, operating system, the pages of our App that you visit,
                    the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and
                    other statistics.
                </p>
                <h2>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    This Privacy Policy is effective as of [Effective Date] and will remain
                    in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the
                    future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this
                    page. We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at
                    any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your
                    continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the
                    Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the
                    modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified
                    Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify
                    you either through the email address you have provided us or by placing
