        <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
        <p>
          At PawPal, transparency and honesty are core values we uphold in our
          interactions with our valued users. This disclosure is intended to
          inform you that some of the links on our app are affiliate links,
          which means we may earn a commission if you click on the link or make
          a purchase using the link. This comes at no additional cost to you,
          but helps us to keep providing you with high-quality content and
          services.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Approach to Affiliate Marketing</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in the products and services we promote and have carefully
          selected these affiliates to ensure they align with our values and the
          needs of our users. Our goal is to provide you with valuable
          information and options, not to sway you towards purchasing any
          particular product or service.
        </p>
        <h2>How Affiliate Links Work</h2>
        <p>
          When you click on an affiliate link and make a purchase, we receive a
          commission from the affiliate partner. This commission comes at no
          extra cost to you. It's important to note that we only link to
          products and services that we believe will provide value to our users.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Trust is Our Priority</h2>
        <p>
          Your trust is paramount to us. Therefore, we strive to be upfront and
          transparent about our affiliate relationships. We want you to feel
          confident that our content is not unduly influenced by our affiliate
          partnerships.
        </p>
        <h2>Questions or Concerns</h2>
        <p>
          If you have any questions or concerns about our use of affiliate
          links, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at [Your Contact
          Information]. We are committed to addressing any queries you may have.
